Nextcloud offers the possibility of using LDAP groups from UCS. This make it easier to share a folder to a range of people, for instance. To include a specific group they can be enabled from within their extended settings in UCS. For a significantly better performance, please make sure that the <a href="https://help.univention.com/t/memberof-attribute-group-memberships-of-user-and-computer-objects/6439" target="_blank">memberOf overlay</a> is activated. In domains that were installed with at least UCS 4.3 it is activated by default.

Also, if the host webserver does not have HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled, it is recommend to configure it. More information can be found in <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/28/admin_manual/installation/harden_server.html#enable-http-strict-transport-security" target="_blank">our documentation</a>.
